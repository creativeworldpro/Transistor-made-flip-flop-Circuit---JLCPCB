# Transistor-made-flip-flop-Circuit---JLCPCB
In this project, we’ll teach you making a led flip-flop circuit. A Flip-Flop LED flashing circuit is a basic circuit that produces a continuous square wave blinking output. In this project, we are going to design a simple Flip-Flop LED Flashing Circuit Using a stable multi vibrator. The heart of this circuit is S-9013 transistor. This difference causes one transistor to turn on fast than the other when power is switched on for the first time. The flashing period is approximately the product of this resistance and the capacitance which is about 1 sec. The 560Ω resistors set the LED current and may be reduced for lower battery voltage.
